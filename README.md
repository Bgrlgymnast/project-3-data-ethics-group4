Our Group decided to go the Data Visualizations route.

This project will review Covid-19 data sets and will compare deaths from Covid-19, Influenza and Pneumonia from 2023. The data sets are for the United States as a whole and then will be broken down specifically from state to state.

Specifically this project will review:
- Total number of deaths by sex for Covid-19, Influenza and Pneumonia.
- Total number of deaths by age range for Covid-19, Influenza and Pneumonia.
- Total number (percentage) of deaths for each individual for each illness.
- While taking into consideration the total population for the United States based on the US Decennial Census data which was last updated in 2020.

# Data Visualization Track Requirements
## Data and Delivery
- The dataset contains at least 100 unique records.

- A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

- The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following:

    - An overview of the project and its purpose

    - Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

    - At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

    - References for the data source(s)

-   -References for any code used that is not your own

## Visualizations 
- A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
- The visualizations are presented in a clear, digestible manner.
- The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels.

## Usability
- The script, notebook, or webpage created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 

- A Python or JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project.

- The project includes some level of user-driven interaction, conforming to one of the following designs:

    - HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

    - Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

    - Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data
