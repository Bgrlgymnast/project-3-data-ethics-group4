# Data Visualization Track Requirements
## Data and Delivery
- The dataset contains at least 100 unique records.

- A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

- The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following:

    - An overview of the project and its purpose

    - Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

    - At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

    - References for the data source(s)

-   -References for any code used that is not your own

## Visualizations 
- A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
    - The visualizations are presented in a clear, digestible manner.
    - The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels.

## Usability
- The script, notebook, or webpage created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 

- A Python or JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. (10 points)

- The project includes some level of user-driven interaction, conforming to one of the following designs: (10 points)

    - HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

    - Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

    - Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data

# Data Engineering Track Requirements
## Database Design
- The project uses ETL workflows to ingest data into the database.

- The original dataset(s) are transformed prior to storing it in the database.

- A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

- The database has at least two tables (SQL) or collections (NoSQL).

- The project documents the choice of the database used and why.

- The project includes documentation of the ETL workflow with diagrams or ERD.

## Data and Delivery 
- The database contains at least 100 unique records. 

- The project uses one additional library not covered in class related to data engineering. (10 points)

- The project includes a method for reading data from the database and displaying it for future use, such as: (10 points)

    - Pandas DataFrame

    - Flask API with JSON output

- The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following: (10 points)

    - An overview of the project and its purpose

    - Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

    - At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

    - References for the data source(s)

    - References for any code used that is not your own
